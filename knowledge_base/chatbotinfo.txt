What is Smart FAQ:

Smart FAQ  is an AI-powered chatbot with a React, Vite, and 
TypeScript frontend and a FastAPI backend powered by Hugging Faceâ€™s google/flan-t5-small. 
It provides context-aware answers through a floating widget and clean conversation UI. Currently,
 it responds with helpful answers and fallback jokes when uncertain. 
 An upcoming feature will extract knowledge from site pages, ensuring responses are always grounded in real content.
